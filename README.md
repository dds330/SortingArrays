# SortingArrays
The Java program encompasses both the selection sort and bubble sort algorithms, showcasing their distinct approaches to sorting an array of randomly generated integers in ascending order. After prompting the user to input the array size, the program initializes an array with random integer values. The selection sort algorithm efficiently iterates through the array, selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element. Simultaneously, the bubble sort algorithm performs multiple passes through the array, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. Both algorithms measure the execution time of their respective sorting processes, providing valuable insights into their comparative performance. This program offers a concise and informative illustration of both selection sort and bubble sort, highlighting their distinct methodologies and time complexities in the context of array sorting.
